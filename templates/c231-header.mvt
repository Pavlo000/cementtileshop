The new Pacific Brass Collection is a dynamic addition to our handcrafted encaustic cement tile options. Our brass tiles feature high quality Japanese brass and are most suitable for dry vertical installations. Although some patterns are in stock, we can add brass to any pattern you see on our site and they can be be customized in the colors of your choice by special order. Brass patterns can be combined with non-brass patterns and solids to create a totally unique look. All tiles are 8" x 8" unless noted otherwise.
