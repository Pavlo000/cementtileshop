Our Pacific Shapes 6" x 6" Collection is perfect for backsplashes, stair risers and shower floors. These tiles are smaller (15 cm x 15 cm) and thinner (1.2 cm) than our standard tiles. The smaller size makes for an easy installation and a smaller scale pattern wherever you need it.
<br><br>Many of these patterns are in stock and ready to ship. In stock tiles can also be found quickly in the in stock section of the website or are noted on each product page. Most other patterns on our website can be custom made in 6" x 6" via special order. Special order tiles (patterns or colors not in stock) typically ship in 12-16 weeks.
