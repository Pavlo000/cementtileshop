Handmade Cement Tile Appearance
Cement tile gets its beauty and richness from its handmade nature.
Please be aware that cement tile is a handmade product. Cement tiles will not be identical from piece to piece. Variations such as size, shade, imperfections, irregular edges and the appearance of fine cracks are inherent to this product and can vary from piece to piece. This adds to the natural appeal and does not compromise the performance of the tile.
Due to these qualities, there will be a variance in every item. All cement tiles may suffer color tone changes over time and with regular maintenance. To ensure the best color match, place orders for all quantities to complete the installation, including extras for damage, cuts and waste. We recommend 10% to be added to all measurements. Material should be mixed from different cartons during installation to provide a cohesive installation.
Sample tiles are representative of colors, but may vary from batch to batch. Cement Tile Shop is not responsible for the appearance or differences of samples provided by manufacturers or local suppliers/showrooms.
Shipping
Small orders are shipped through FEDEX or UPS. Larger orders are shipped via LTL Freight Carriers. Customer is responsible for all shipping charges.
Order Lead Time
In stock orders ship within 48 hours of order time. Special order tiles typically take between 8-12 weeks to ship, but can take longer based on production schedules and times of year.
Payment Terms
A 50% non-refundable deposit is required for all large or custom orders to begin production. Payment for the remaining balance will be due upon completion of your order. Once full payment is received we will release the shipment. Full payment is required in advance for all sample orders.
Order Cancellation Policy
Due to the fact that we do not stock custom designs and colors, we cannot accept order cancellations after production has begun.
Sales Tax
Sales tax will be charged on all applicable orders within the state of Florida. Sales tax can be waived with a valid resale certificate.
Damaged Merchandise
All products leave our dock in good condition and are properly packed. All claims for damaged and broken merchandise must be made through your carrier.
Customer is responsible for the inspection of all material when received. Pictures will be required to assist in any claim for damaged material. Please note any damage on the freight company Bill of Lading at the time of delivery. No claim for damage can be accepted if not noted at the time of delivery.
Please do not refuse the shipment! If you find damage, missing material, or incorrect quantities accept the shipment and note the issues in detail on the receipt with the driver. If damage is properly noted, we can begin the process of getting replacement material to you.
We must be notified immediately of any material shortage.
Order Return Policy
All claims regarding color, design, quality, or quantity must be resolved prior to installation. Any returns require a RMA number. Returns must be made in the original packaging and credited upon inspection in our warehouse. Freight is responsibility of customer. No claims will be accepted for any reason after installation.
