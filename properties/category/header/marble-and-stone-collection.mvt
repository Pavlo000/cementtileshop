<p>Our marble and stone mosaics are of the highest quality. We offer many different shapes and patterns that are available for quick shipping.</p>

<p>Stone mosaics can be used commercially or in a residential setting, for interiors and exteriors, and can be applied to walls and floors. Stone mosaics have irregular edges, chips, indentations and variations in color, shade and thickness - no two tiles look the same, nor are they meant to! Differences from piece to piece are natural and create a blended look when installed.</p>
